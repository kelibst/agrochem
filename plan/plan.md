## Development Guidelines

### Color System & Theming
The AgroConnect app uses a comprehensive universal theme system with 50+ semantic color variables. See [`color-system-guide.md`](./color-system-guide.md) for complete documentation on:

- **Universal Color Variables**: Single source of truth for all colors
- **Theme-Aware Design**: Perfect light/dark mode support with automatic switching
- **Semantic Naming**: Meaningful color names (`theme.star`, `theme.success`, etc.)
- **Pre-built Utilities**: Ready-to-use style functions and components
- **Migration Guide**: How to convert from Tailwind/hardcoded colors to theme system
- **Best Practices**: Proper usage patterns and common pitfalls to avoid

**Key Principles:**
- ✅ Always use `theme.colorName` instead of hardcoded hex values
- ✅ Use semantic colors (`theme.star` not `#FFD700`)
- ✅ Follow container + onContainer pattern for proper contrast
- ✅ Leverage pre-built styles from `createThemeStyles(theme)`
- ❌ Never use hardcoded colors or Tailwind classes for colors

### Component Architecture
- **Theme Integration**: All components must use `useTheme()` hook
- **Consistent Styling**: Use theme utilities for shadows, borders, and spacing
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support for all theme colors
- **Performance**: Optimized re-renders and efficient color calculations
