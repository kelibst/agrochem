### Major Enhancement: Theme System & Dark Mode Implementation

#### üé® **Advanced Theme Architecture**
Implemented a comprehensive theming system with React Context:

1. **ThemeContext** (`src/context/ThemeContext.tsx`)
   - Complete theme color definitions for light and dark modes
   - Three theme modes: Light, Dark, and System (auto-detect)
   - Centralized theme management with React Context
   - Type-safe theme colors with TypeScript interfaces

2. **Theme Colors Structure**:
   ```typescript
   - background, surface, surfaceVariant
   - text, textSecondary, textTertiary
   - primary, primaryContainer, onPrimary, onPrimaryContainer
   - secondary, accent colors with containers
   - success, warning, error, info status colors
   - border, divider, card, input colors
   ```

#### üåô **Dark Mode Implementation**
- **Automatic system detection** using React Native's `useColorScheme`
- **Manual theme switching** with smooth transitions
- **Optimized dark colors** that maintain accessibility and brand consistency
- **Proper contrast ratios** for all text and interactive elements

#### üîß **Component Theme Integration**
Updated all components to use the theme system:

1. **Button Component**: Dynamic colors based on theme and variant
2. **Card Components**: Theme-aware backgrounds, borders, and shadows
3. **Input Components**: Themed borders, backgrounds, and text colors
4. **All Screen Components**: Removed hardcoded colors, use theme context

#### üéõÔ∏è **Developer Experience Enhancements**

   - Quick access to developer menu from any screen
   - Smooth animations with spring physics
   - Easy to remove for production (single component)

2. **ThemeToggle** (`src/components/ThemeToggle.tsx`)
   - Interactive theme switcher with animations
   - Cycles through: Light ‚Üí Dark ‚Üí System
   - Visual icons for each theme mode
   - Integrated into developer menu header

3. **Enhanced Developer Menu**
